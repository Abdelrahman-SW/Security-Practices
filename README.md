<h3 align="center" > 🛡️ --- An Android App In Kotlin & Jetpack Compose For Security Practices --- 🛡️</h3>

<h2 align="left">About :</h2>

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of best security practices in Android development. It showcases the implementation of various techniques to secure data, including:

🔒 SQLCipher: Encrypted local database storage.

🔒 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Symmetric encryption for secure data transmission.

🔒 RSA: Asymmetric encryption for key exchange and secure communication.

🔒 Digital Signatures: Verifying the authenticity of data with private and public keys.

🔒 Hashing: Storing passwords securely using hashing algorithms like SHA-256.

🔒 HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code): Ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

🔒 Hashing with Salt: Adding salt to hashes to defend against rainbow table attacks.

🔒 Secure Random: Generating cryptographically secure random numbers for key generation.

🔐 KeyStore: Safely storing cryptographic keys and performing operations securely on the device.

This project is designed to demonstrate real-world security implementations for Android apps and emphasizes best practices to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
